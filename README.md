# AI powered typing assistant with Ollama

A script that can run in the background and listen to hotkeys, then uses a Large Language Model to fix the text. Less than 100 lines of code.

Inspired by this tweet:

You'll find a demo and step-by-step code explanations on my YouTube channel:

## Get Started

### 1. Set up Ollama

Ollama Installation: https://github.com/ollama/ollama

Run `ollama run mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_K_S`

Mistal 7B Instruct works well for this task, but feel free to try other models, too :)

### 2. Install dependencies
This application requires Python 3.11 or lower version. 3.12 isn't supported as no compatible *pynput* package release is available for this Python version.  
```
pip install pynput pyperclip httpx
```

- pynput: https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- pyperclip: https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip
- httpx: https://github.com/encode/httpx/

### 3. Run it

Start the assistant:

```
python main.py
```

Hotkeys you can then press:

- F9: Fixes the current line (without having to select the text)
- F10: Fixes the current selection

**Note**: You may get an error the first time saying `This process is not trusted! Input event monitoring will not be possible until it is added to accessibility clients`. On Mac, you need to add the script (IDE/terminal) both on accessibility and input monitoring.

**Note**: The code works on macOS. The underlying shortcuts in the code like Cmd+Shift+Left, Cmd+C, Cmd+V might have to be changed for Linux & Windows (e.g. `Key.cmd` -> `Key.ctrl`).

## Customize

Hotkeys, prompt, and Ollama config can be easily customized and extended in the code.

For example, here are some prompt templates you can try:

```python
from string import Template

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FIX_TEXT = Template(
    """Fix all typos and casing and punctuation in this text, but preserve all new line characters:

$text

Return only the corrected text."""
)

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GENERATE_TEXT = Template(
    """Generate a snarky paragraph with 3 sentences about the following topic:

$text

Return only the corrected text."""
)

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_SUMMARIZE_TEXT = Template(
    """Summarize the following text in 3 sentences:

$text

Return only the corrected text."""
)
```
